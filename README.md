# Mini OOP Project in C++

This project contains several classes that model elements from a pharmacy system (Employee, Medicine, CovidTest, Prescription, and Goods). The purpose of the project was to apply OOP concepts in C++ and work with dynamic memory.

## Main Features
- defining and using classes with private attributes and public methods
- multiple constructors, destructor, copy constructor and operator=
- managing dynamic memory for char* fields and arrays
- using static members and an enum for test types
- overloading the >> and << operators for input and output

The project helped me better understand how OOP mechanisms are correctly implemented in C++ and how resources are managed within an application.
